* Users have the abilty to include different types of characters dependent on their specific needs. 
* The application creates a random password dependent on the user choices. 

### Walkthrough 
The end user starts by clicking the generate password button in red. 
The end user is then alerted that they will be creating a secure password. 
The end user will be asked to enter a number between 8 and 128. 
If the end user enters anything but the expected values, they will be alerted to re-enter a number that fits the parameters. 
Once the end user enters a valid value, they will be alerted that they are going to choose the criteria for the password, and must choose at least one of the choices to proceed. 
The user will then select OK to include a criteria, or cancel to forgo that option. 
Once all choices have been made, a password will generate in the center of the screen for the user to copy and use as they see fit.
